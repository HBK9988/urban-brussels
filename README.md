# About project

raise public awareness around Brusselsâ€™heritage and build the city of tomorrow today.

This project focuses primarily on architectural students and researchers but also on people who
want to modify certain aspects of buildings and landscape and want to check the legality of this.
Another target audience are tourists who would like to inform themselves about Brussels & architecture.

# Usage
[Landing Page]
The landing page is built up with a large dynamic map as background. On top of the map in
the top right corner we have a button that directly redirects to the dashboard page (see later), and a button to change your language (from dutch to french and vice versa). In the bottom right corner we have a button to change the map shown. Here we see the version where we clicked on the button already, showing the different options. These options are defined to be either our custom Mapbox map (shown here as background), the black and white BruGIS/UrbGIS map or an aerial map of Brussels.
